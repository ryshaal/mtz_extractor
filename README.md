# MTZ Extractor - Xiaomi MIUI Themes Extractor

This repository contains a Python script for extracting `.mtz` files, specifically designed for Xiaomi MIUI themes.  
The script allows easy access to the contents of `.mtz` theme files, making theme customization and modification much simpler.

In addition, a desktop application version is also available â€” a Python-based app for extracting, compressing, and managing MIUI theme files (`.mtz`).  
It is built using **CustomTkinter**, featuring a modern graphical interface with **drag-and-drop** support.
